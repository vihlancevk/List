# List
It is one of the most popular data structures,
which will be useful for me in the next projects. 
My implementation has a unique feature - visual dump of the list, and it is also a cache-friendly.
## DumpList
Function, which generates a *listLog.html* file, containing the information about the list and a visual presentation of the list,
which is created with the help of Graphviz (https://graphviz.org/).
