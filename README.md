# StructList
It is one of the most popular data structures,
which will be useful for me in the next projects. 
My implementation has a unique feature - visual dump of the list.
## DumpList
Function, which generates a listLog.html file, containing the information about the list and a visual presentation of the list,
which is created with the help of Graphviz (https://graphviz.org/).
